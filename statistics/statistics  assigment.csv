 Hypothesis example:,,,,
,,,,
pop mean ,40,,ho : u = 40,
n,36,,h1 : u != 40,
sam mean,41.2,,,
pop std,3.6,,,
alpa ,0.05,,,
,,,,
ho: m = 40,,,,
h1: m != 40,,,,
,,,,
z test ,2,,,
 p value ,0.045500264,,,
,,,,
so we  rejected H0,,,,
,,,,
"2*(1 - NORM.S.DIST(ABS(Z), TRUE))",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
pop std 1 ,4,,,
pop std 2,5,,,
sam n1,50,,ho : u1 = u2,
sam n2,60,,h1 : u1 != u2,
sam m 1,82,,,
sam m 2,79,,,
,,,,
z test ,3.495310368,,,
p value ,0.000473511,,,
,,,,
so we rejected Ho,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,ho : mean is not differs u = 500,
Branch,Daily Sales ($),,h1 : mean is differe u != 500,
